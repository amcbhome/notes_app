## Linear regression
```bash
The simple linear regression model is:
$$
y = a + bx
$$
Where:

- $y$ = dependent variable (e.g. cost)
- $x$ = independent variable (e.g. activity level)
- $a$ = fixed cost (intercept)
- $b$ = variable cost per unit (slope)

This model is widely used in management accounting for cost estimation.
